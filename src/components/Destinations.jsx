      "November is one of the best times to visit Kenya, especially its prime park, Maasai Mara. The large migratory herds return to Tanzania, forcing the big cats to travel long distances to hunt. This period also marks the season of short rains, turning the Maasai Mara plains lush green, with dramatic and colorful skies. Sunrises and sunsets are breathtaking during this time. We have curated this itinerary at an affordable cost to celebrate our first anniversary of operations in Nairobi.",
